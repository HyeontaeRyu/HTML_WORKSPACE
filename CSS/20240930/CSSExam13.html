      SpongeBob is an over-optimistic sea sponge who lives in a pineapple in the
      underwater city of Bikini Bottom. He works at the Krusty Krab restaurant
      and spends his free time with his best friend, a starfish named Patrick.
      SpongeBob is always getting into trouble, but he always manages to get out
      of it.
